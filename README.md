I am a Software Engineer from Pakistan, developing projects by collaborating with 
international individuals in AI, including Generative AI, AI agents, and RAG. I 
contribute to building backends using Flask or Node.js. I have also worked on various IoT
projects using hardware like ESP32, ESP8266, and Arduino Uno, collecting environmental 
data and sending it to databases or the cloud via APIs.

I do problem-solving in C++ and have participated in different international coding 
competitions ([Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), [Meta Hacker Cup](https://web.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup), [Google Coding Farewell](#), [Harvard's CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/puzzles/) ). I love to teach and learn, which led me to teach Python [@Stanford's Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), conduct IoT workshops, and present LeetCode problems to underprivileged students [@iCodeGuru](https://icode.guru/). <br>
I also competed in international hackathons with a team ([@lablab.ai](https://lablab.ai/event), [@genai.works](https://genai.works/hackathon), [elevenlabs.io](https://hackathon.elevenlabs.io/)), these three of the projects were recognized with awards:

[Teepon](https://github.com/inamprograms/Teepon) â€“ Platform: lablab.ai, Award: Silver/Gold â€“ LinkedIn Post
[Food Complaint Resolution](https://github.com/inamprograms/Food-complaint-resolution-app) Platform: lablab.ai, Award: Silver/Gold â€“ LinkedIn Post
[EquiDonate](https://github.com/inamprograms/EquiDonate) â€“ Platform: lablab.ai, Award: Silver/Gold â€“ LinkedIn Post
